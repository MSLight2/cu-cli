### UC-CLI

[中文文档](https://github.com/MSLight2/uc-cli/blob/master/README_zh-cn.md)

**User custom cli tool based on `Webpack4`**

A tool for building `Vue / React` projects. Can quickly build projects. Currently, only `Vue` project construction is supported.

There are two modes of manual build and default build.

In manual build mode, you can choose different configurations. For example: whether to add `vue-router`, `vuex`, etc

After the project is built successfully, you can change the `webpack` configuration in the build folder

The function is similar to `vue-cli`

- You can view the webpack configuration template in the 'template' branch of [Github](https://github.com/MSLight2/uc-cli)

#### Usage:
