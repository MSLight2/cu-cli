### UC-CLI

**User custom cli tool based on `Webpack4`**

A tool for building `Vue / React` projects. Can quickly build projects. Currently, only `Vue` project construction is supported.

There are two modes of manual build and default build.

In manual build mode, you can choose different configurations. For example: whether to add Vue router, vuex, etc

After the project is built successfully, you can change the `webpack` configuration in the build folder

The function is similar to `vue-cli` or  `create-react-app`

- The configuration template can be viewed in the template branch
